# MyRcs
This is a .git package to store my rc configurations file!

everything in ~/bin is local written functions,

~/.bash_completion is usefull (need also bash-completion package installed (by default in ubuntu))

~/.bashrc is not very different from the basic one

~/.bash_aliases is very different, a lot of home made function and alias, with completion activated
